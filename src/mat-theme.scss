// I only want to iclude the basic styling the comes from mat-core() -- but there is an annoying warning message in the console if you don't include the rest. So I include it, and, luckily but strangely, it doesn't seem to affect the styling at all.

// have to load a single css file for Angular Material in your app.
// Be sure that you only ever include this mixin once!

// (imported above). For each palette, you can optionally specify a default, lighter, and darker
// hue.
